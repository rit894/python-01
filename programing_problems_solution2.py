'''Michael works as a marketing executive and spends his whole day travelling around 
getting orders for his company. Sometimes the trips are short and often times he has to 
travel large distances on his two wheelers. He decides his outfit based on the climate so 
that he is comfortable when he is at work. The decision is made as follows: If the day 
is cold and it is snowing, he wears a parka. If it is cold and not snowing, he wears a 
jacket. If the day is not cold, He wears formal outfit. Design an automatic decision 
making system to help Michael to choose his outfit, given a list of day type 
combinations (cold and snowing).'''

'''Simson works as a boiler controller in ‘Powerful Boiler Industries’ as a boiler operator 
for power generation. There are certain guidelines for the operation of the boiler to work 
in standard operating conditions. Any kind of abnormal function is notified by a 
temperature indicator which measures the temperature in the boiler and sounds an 
appropriate alarm.  
a. If the temperature falls below 140 F for 5 minutes and the heating burner is off, 
then the ‘under heat alarm’ signals.  
b. If the temperature is between 140 F and 200 F and the heating burner is off, then 
the ‘normal alarm’ signals.  
c. If the temperature is greater than 200 F for more than 10 minutes and the heating 
burner is on, ‘over heat alarm’ signals. '''
